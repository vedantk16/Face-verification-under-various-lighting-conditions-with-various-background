# Face-verification-under-various-lighting-conditions-with-various-background

Robustness to different nuisance parameters:
Given a pair of images, your trained model should be able to tell whether the faces in the images belong to the same person or not. The test images can be captured under various lighting conditions with various backgrounds. Your trained model should be robust to lighting/illumination changes, image resolution, image aspect ratio, background clutter, the morphing of faces (like expressions, wearing glasses etc.) and so on. However, the only thing that can be assured would be that all faces in the test set will be frontal and not side profiles of the faces.
